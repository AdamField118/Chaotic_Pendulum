# Overview  

In Intermediate Physics Laboratory (2025) we have a project to analyze a chaotic pendulum system. The MATLAB code given to us for tracking LEDs in a video was broken, old, and quite frankly bad, so we developed a new solution using openCV and other python libraries. If you are a future group doing this lab and hope to code something cool, consider forking this repository!
